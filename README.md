# Vex Panel
Vex Panel is a free and open source panel for Pterodactyl v1. Vex Panel has many features such as Idling for coins, product stock, an admin page, built in API for a Discord bot, and so much more to come. Vex Panel was originally made because there isn't a really great panel for Pterodactyl v1 that's written in PHP. 

# Vex v1
Vex Panel v1 will sadly not be open source. Instead, we will host it! You can get it free up-to 100 users, and after that you need to pay $1/mo for every 100 users after 100. This is so we can manage everything, make sure everything is up-to date, and to provide an easier way to manage your Vex Panel! For more information, please join our Discord server.
