# Vex Panel
Vex Panel is a free and open source panel for Pterodactyl v1. Vex Panel has many features such as Idling for coins, product stock, an admin page, built in API for a Discord bot, and so much more to come. Vex Panel was originally made because there isn't a really great panel for Pterodactyl v1 that's written in PHP.
